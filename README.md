# RemWaste Management QA Engineering Challenge

Welcome to the RemWaste QA Engineering Challenge project repository!

This repository contains two full-stack projects—a backend and a frontend—centered around a modern Todo App. The goal is to demonstrate best practices in both backend API development and frontend application engineering, with a focus on quality, testing, and maintainability.
