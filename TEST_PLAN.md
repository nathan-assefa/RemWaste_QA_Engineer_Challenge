# Test Plan / Test Strategy for Modern Todo App

## 1. What is being tested

The testing scope covers both backend and frontend components of the Modern Todo App, ensuring a reliable, secure, and seamless user experience.

### Backend (Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma)

- **User Authentication:** Signup, login, logout, and user session validation
- **Todo Management:** Create, read, update, delete todo items with proper authorization
- **Security:** JWT token handling, route protection, error handling
- **Data Integrity:** Database operations via Prisma, validation of request payloads

### Frontend (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)

- **Authentication UI:** Signup and login forms, validation, error handling, navigation
- **Todo UI:** CRUD operations, task filtering, state management, responsive design
- **User Interaction:** Smooth animations, loading states, and UX flows
- **Routing:** Protected routes accessible only to authenticated users

### Note:

The backend and frontend are currently not integrated but fully prepared for integration. This separation allows focused, independent testing of each layer. When integration is desired, the frontend can consume the backend APIs directly without significant code changes

## 2. Test coverage areas

### Backend

- **Unit & Integration Tests (Jest & Supertest)**

  - Authentication flows: successful and failed signup/login scenarios
  - Token validation and secure middleware behavior
  - CRUD operations on todos with valid and invalid inputs
  - Edge cases: missing fields, unauthorized access, non-existent resource handling

### Frontend

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Cypress)**

  - Complete user journey: signup/login → todo creation → update → deletion
  - UI validation: form errors, button states, loading indicators
  - Responsive behavior across screen sizes
  - Route guards: redirect unauthenticated users, allow authorized access

## 3. Tools used and why

| Tool           | Purpose                                         | Rationale                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Jest**       | Unit and integration testing for backend logic  | Widely used, supports mocks, fast        |
| **Supertest**  | HTTP assertions on Express endpoints            | Simplifies API endpoint testing          |
| **Prisma**     | ORM for database interaction                    | Type-safe DB access, easy to mock/test   |
| **Cypress**    | Frontend end-to-end UI testing                  | Real browser testing, developer-friendly |
| **TypeScript** | Strong typing in both backend and frontend code | Prevents runtime errors, better tooling  |

## 4. How to run the tests

### Backend tests (Jest & Supertest)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Ensure .env file is configured with DB and JWT_SECRET

# Run database migrations (if not done)
npx prisma migrate dev

# Run backend tests
npm run test
```

### Frontend tests (Cypress)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, open Cypress Test Runner (interactive)
npm run cypress:open

# Or run Cypress headless (CI)
npm run cypress:run
```

---

## 5. Assumptions and limitations

- **Assumptions**

  - Environment variables (e.g., JWT_SECRET, DB_URL) are properly configured before running tests.
  - The backend and frontend run locally on default ports unless otherwise configured.
  - Database contains seeded or mock data appropriate for testing.
  - Users have a basic understanding of command-line operations.

- **Limitations**

  - Backend tests rely on mocks for Prisma; may not cover every DB edge case.
  - Cypress E2E tests simulate user behavior but do not test all possible edge cases or accessibility standards.
  - Performance and load testing are outside the current scope.
  - No automated security testing (e.g., penetration tests) included.

**This test plan ensures robust verification of key functional areas, providing confidence in application stability, security, and user experience before deployment.**
